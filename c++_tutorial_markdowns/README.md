# What is this folder for?

Since our club is 
all about that "no experience required", we have to invest some effort into teaching
new members.

This is compounded by C++ is rather infamous for being a hard to learn language. Which
is made even worse by the... dubious quality of C++ tutorial/content online. Most
books that try to teach C++ are also rather bad.

This folder attempts to collect good resources from the web about concepts and
good practices in modern C++. Some parts of the READMEs will contain original 
tutorials from our members, others will simply link to good resources online.

If you want to contribute an original tutorial (assuming you are confident in the
subject of course), try to make sure it is either
- something a bit "subjective" for lack of a better word, like an idea for design
- a way of thinking/teaching that you think would be a good fit for the club

If it's highly technical, try to defer to a good quality explanation elsewhere 
on the web.

We will not be teaching stuff like C++ syntax here. Syntax is the most basic 
part of a language, even the really bad online tutorials will give
a good lesson in it. Plus, you can always just read our current code to get 
familiar with C++ syntax.
