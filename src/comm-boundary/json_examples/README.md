## JSON examples

This directory contains examples on what the specific
JSON structure our GUI is looking for when parsing (in both directions)

All these examples are up-to-date in structure, and should be relied upon by the frontend peeps as the definitive documentation
of what JSONs we send back and expect from them. Because of that, these examples need to be updated ASAP if we change 
our JSON structure.

NOTE: these examples are meant to be completely generic, only showing the structure of the JSON. for example, `valve1` as a valve in the command JSON doesn't mean there's a `valve1` on the actual ECS
